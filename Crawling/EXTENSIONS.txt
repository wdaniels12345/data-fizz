Products outside of the Household Essentials category.

This program can be edited to display products outside of the household essentials category. I would assume that every product displayed on walgreens.com domain 
uses the same html tags so the only things that would need to be updated were the url's by which the script chooses to launch. A function to traverse the walgreens.com 
must also be implemented, because I failed to do that in the actual program. This is elaborated upon in the README file. 


Domains beyond Walgreens.com.

This becomes a little more difficult. Logically, the program should work for any webpage that displays product information, however every website is built with different html designs. 
So not only will URL's need to be edited like I mentioned in the previous answer, but also tags used to parse the html information must be edited, because every website will have
seperate and unique names for this info.
